In this project I will make poker played by different AIs to see which is the best
the main goals are to learn about how to call different APIs and interact with prompt
engineering to make it happen.

The basic rules of Poker are (Hold em) (from a site by carnigie melon):
The very basics: 

Played with 52 cards - cards ranked from Ace-K-Q-J-10-...

Will be playing hold em, the player sees 2 cards, 3 come out on the flop, 1 more on the turn, and one final one on the river
the player will have to make the best 5 cards they can from the 5 on the board and their two

Hands are ranked as followed:
Straight Flush - 5 cards ascending in order by one which are all the same suit (3H,4H,5H,6H,7H) if there are two the highest one will win
Four of a kind - Four of the same cards, highest one wins (cant follow a simple high card function)
Full House - Where the player has a three of a kind and then a two of a kind, ties are broken by who has the highest three of a kind, and then by who has the highest pair if the other is the same
Flush - a hand where all the cards have the same suit.
Straight - a hand where has 5 cards ascending in order by ones
Three of a Kind - three of the same cards together (they cant have another pair) - also high cards
Two Pair - two different pairs and a distinct 5th card - highest first pair wins and if not then the secont pair decides (both are the same the kicker decides)
Pair - One pair and if tied the high cards break
High Card

Betting
Big blind and little blind.
Call (which can be done after a raise and it is to reach the same denom as was betted)
Raise (a bet which exceeds the amount of a call or if its the first bet just any money bet)
Fold letting your hand go.

How I want to apporach this: 
first create a card class and handle the deck shuffling and creation
code the rules next, put in different combinations of 5 hands to see if it actually understands what wins
create a game loop and get the looping through each player working
make the game work without betting and just see who wins every hand
adding betting and folding to the game
add some sort of visual to actually see what is going on
link AIs to have them play and see who wins
